# 🎯 Programming Fundamentals Final Project
# Xonix Game
## 📖 Overview

Xonix Game is a 2D arcade-style game developed using SFML in C++. The base game was already designed, and our task was to enhance it with new interactive features, including single and two-player modes, difficulty levels, enemy patterns, scoring, and rewards.

The game challenges players to construct tiles while avoiding moving enemies, collecting points as they progress. It demonstrates concepts of game logic, AI-controlled enemy patterns, player interaction, and scoring mechanics.
